    <h2>Q & A</h2>
    <div class="qna-block">
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why Koharu for the domain name? Is Shimoe Koharu the character you like most?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> <b>Yes,</b> before <a href="https://bluearchive.fandom.com/wiki/Plana">Plana</a> get revealed. But it's true that I still like Shimoe Koharu a lot!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qna-block">
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Then you should register the domain name using the name of Plana, isn't it?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> <b>I wanted to. Really.</b> but the domain names like <code>plana.dev</code>, <code>plana.moe</code>, and <code>plana.app</code> are already registered by others.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qna-block">
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> I think you are lazy and/or salty to find unregistered-but-looking-good domain names of Plana.</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> What's wrong with you? What the heck of this question is? I have nothing to say for this question. Period.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="qna-block">
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Okay, nevermind. What's the purpose of this domain name by the way?</p>
